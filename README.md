# Analyzing-Customer-Churn
Using Tableau to investigate a sample dataset for Databel and analyze their churn rates.

"Analyzing churn doesn’t just mean knowing what the churn rate is: it’s also about figuring out why customers are churning at the rate they are, and how to reduce churn."

A CSV file of 6687 rows of data for Databel customers were imported into Tableau. A data check was then performed to make sure there were no duplicate rows.
Once that was performed the dataset was explored to get a better understanding of why customers were churning and the churning patterns. 

Several interactive dashboards were created. 
* Created calculated fields 
* Used various visualization such as dual-axis graphs, maps, scatter plots, etc. 
* Created filters and parameters to make dashboard dynamic and interactive.
* Combined everything into a story to share insights from various dashboards.


The first dashboard gives an overview of the customer churn for Databel. From the treemap you can immediately tell competitors is the top reason customets have left.

The next dashboard further breaks down the data into age and those on a group plan. The churn appears to increase as the customer ages, and those who are not on a group plan.

The next dashboard focuses on the payment methods and the type of contract they are under. Those that are on the month-to-month plan and not locked into a yearly+ plan tend to leave more.

The last dashboard explores if they have unlimeted data or not and how many GB they have with their plan. It also displays information on the international plan that are associated with some accounts.

Management can now use the Churn Analysis Story to investigate different reason customers churned, use the map to investigate churn rate by state, observe the demographics of their customer, and more. This can help them decide when, where, and to whom to offer promotions. Inform current customers who may churn of other plans they offer that may suit their needs. Overall they will be able to identify the main causes of churn and how to reduce it.
